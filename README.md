THIS IS A SMALL RECIPE APP DEMO BUILT USING THE FOLLOWING TECHNOLOGIES:
- REACTJS
- REDUX
- MATERIAL UI / MATERIAL ICONS
- JEST & ENZYME
- HOT MODULE LOADING
- BROWSER SYNC
- ESLINT
- LOCAL STORAGE

IT WAS BUILT USING THE REACT-SLINGSHOT BOILERPLATE

TO USE THE APP, YOU CAN RUN "NPM START" IN YOUR COMMAND LINE AFTER NAVIGATING TO THE APPROPRIATE DIRECTORY. AFTERWARDS YOU WILL BE RUNNING A LOCAL SERVER WHERE YOU CAN ACCESS THE RECIPE APP INTERFACE. THERE YOU WILL SEE AN INITIAL STATE OF TWO RECIPES. YOU CAN CLICK THE EDIT OR DELETE BUTTONS TO MODIFY THOSE RECIPES, OTHERWISE YOU CAN ADD A NEW RECIPE BY NAVIGATING TO THE "NEW RECIPE" PAGE. THERE YOU WILL BE ABLE TO ENTER A NEW RECIPE TITLE, IMAGE URL, INGREDIENTS AND STEPS. AFTER SAVING, THE PAGE WILL REDIRECT TO THE HOME PAGE WHERE YOU WILL NOW SEE YOUR NEW RECIPE.
